# CBT Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎉 **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE**

This is a **complete, production-ready implementation** of Concept-Bottleneck Transformers (CBT) as described in the README.md. All core functionality and research experiments have been implemented.

---

## ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**

### **Core Architecture**
- ✅ **ConceptLayer** with EntMax 1.5 sparsification
- ✅ **CBTModel** with flexible block insertion
- ✅ **Bypass mixing** with α parameter for gradual integration
- ✅ **Top-k selection** for sparsity control
- ✅ **Reconstruction** from concepts back to hidden states

### **All Loss Functions**
- ✅ **Task loss** (language modeling cross-entropy)
- ✅ **Reconstruction loss** (MSE between original and reconstructed hidden states)
- ✅ **Sparsity loss** (L1 penalty on concept activations)
- ✅ **Orthogonality loss** (‖W^D^T W^D - I‖_F^2 to prevent concept duplication)
- ✅ **Stability loss** (Procrustes alignment for concept consistency)
- ✅ **KL distillation** (KL(base || cbt) to maintain quality during α-ramp)
- ✅ **Concept dropout** (ensures distinct concept roles)

### **Training System**
- ✅ **CBTTrainer** with advanced loss management
- ✅ **Alpha scheduling** (gradual ramp from 0 to 1)
- ✅ **Training schedule** (warm-start → reconstruction → blend-in → sparsify)
- ✅ **Wandb integration** for experiment tracking

### **Concept Analysis**
- ✅ **Concept mining** (top activations collection)
- ✅ **LLM-based labeling** (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- ✅ **Concept visualization** (heatmaps, clustering)
- ✅ **Stability analysis** (Procrustes alignment)

### **Ablation & Editing**
- ✅ **Concept ablation** (zero, mean, random ablation types)
- ✅ **Real-time concept editing** during generation
- ✅ **Ablation analysis** and metrics computation
- ✅ **Causal effect measurement**

### **Evaluation System**
- ✅ **Quality evaluation** (≤2% perplexity hit target)
- ✅ **Sparsity evaluation** (≤8 active concepts/token/block)
- ✅ **Stability evaluation** (≥0.8 alignment across seeds)
- ✅ **Causality evaluation** (large, targeted behavior deltas)
- ✅ **Nameability evaluation** (≥70% concepts labeled)

### **Research Experiments**
- ✅ **Granularity sweeps** (m∈{32,64,128}; k∈{4,8,12})
- ✅ **Placement studies** (early vs. mid vs. late blocks)
- ✅ **Cross-seed stability tests** (3+ seeds)
- ✅ **Comprehensive analysis** and reporting

## 📊 **SUCCESS CRITERIA IMPLEMENTATION**

All success criteria from the README have been implemented and can be evaluated:

1. **✅ Quality**: ≤2% perplexity hit vs. baseline
2. **✅ Sparsity**: median ≤8 active concepts/token/block
3. **✅ Stability**: ≥0.8 alignment of concept decoders across seeds
4. **✅ Causality**: editing one concept produces large, targeted behavior deltas
5. **✅ Nameability**: ≥70% concepts receive consistent labels

---

## 🔬 **RESEARCH EXPERIMENTS**

The implementation includes all experiments mentioned in the README:

1. **✅ Ablation matrix**: off/on each concept → track which tasks move
2. **✅ Granularity sweep**: m∈{32,64,128}; k∈{4,8,12} → plot sparsity/quality frontier
3. **✅ Placement study**: concepts in early vs. mid vs. late blocks
4. **✅ Cross-seed stability**: test stability across multiple training seeds

## 🎯 **KEY FEATURES**

### **Real-Time Concept Editing**
```python
# Edit concepts during generation
edited_text = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    concept_edits={"block_4_concept_0": 0.5}
)
```

### **Comprehensive Analysis**
```python
# Mine and label concepts
mining_results = miner.mine_concepts(dataloader)
