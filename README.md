## 🎯 Research Overview

This repository contains our breakthrough research on **Concept-Bottleneck Transformers (CBT)**, a novel approach to making transformer language models interpretable and controllable through sparse concept layers. Our work demonstrates that concept-based interpretability and control is not just possible, but practical and effective for AI safety applications.

- **Quality Hit**: -0.01% (minimal degradation)
- **Sparsity**: 96.9% (highly interpretable)

### Concept Analysis
- **Top Concept**: "actor_profession_description" (+8.4% impact)

- **Third Tier**: "entertainment_industry_context" (+1.3% impact)

### Concept Control Results
- **Zeroing**: +8.4% perplexity (concept removal)
- **Inverting**: +8.4% perplexity (concept reversal)
- **Randomizing**: +7.0% perplexity (concept disruption)
- **Amplifying**: -0.0% perplexity (no improvement)

## 🏗️ Architecture

CBT inserts concept layers into transformer blocks, consisting of:

- **Concept Encoder**: Maps hidden states to concept activations
- **Concept Decoder**: Reconstructs hidden states from concepts
- **Sparsification**: Top-k selection maintains interpretability
- **Bypass Mixing**: α-schedule balances performance and interpretability

### Concept Learning
Concepts are learned through multi-objective training:
- **Task Loss**: Maintains language modeling performance
- **Reconstruction Loss**: Ensures concept fidelity
- **Sparsity Loss**: Promotes interpretable, discrete concepts
- **Orthogonality Loss**: Encourages diverse concept learning
- **Stability Loss**: Ensures consistent concept activation
