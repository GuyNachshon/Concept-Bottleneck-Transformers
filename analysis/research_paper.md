# Concept-Bottleneck Transformers: Interpretable and Controllable Language Models

## Abstract

We present Concept-Bottleneck Transformers (CBT), a novel approach to making transformer language models interpretable and controllable through sparse concept layers. By inserting learnable concept bottlenecks into transformer blocks, we enable direct manipulation of model behavior through concept editing while maintaining performance. Our experiments demonstrate that CBT concepts are causally impactful (8.4% performance change), editable (enabling behavioral control), and fair (no demographic biases). While current concepts are domain-general rather than domain-specific, we establish the foundation for concept-based AI safety and interpretability applications.

## 1. Introduction

Large language models have achieved remarkable performance but remain largely black boxes, making them difficult to interpret and control. This opacity poses significant challenges for AI safety, fairness, and deployment in critical applications. Recent work has explored various interpretability techniques, but few provide both interpretability and control over model behavior.

We introduce Concept-Bottleneck Transformers (CBT), which insert sparse concept layers into transformer models to enable both interpretation and control. Our approach learns discrete, interpretable concepts that can be directly manipulated to change model behavior, providing a pathway toward safer and more controllable AI systems.

### 1.1 Contributions

- **Novel Architecture**: Concept-bottleneck layers that maintain model performance while enabling interpretability
- **Causal Impact**: Demonstrated that concepts have real causal effects on model behavior (8.4% performance change)
- **Concept Control**: Enabled direct editing of concepts to modify model behavior
- **Fairness Validation**: Confirmed that learned concepts do not encode demographic biases
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Extensive analysis of concept quality, interpretability, and controllability

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Interpretability Methods

Previous work on transformer interpretability includes attention analysis, probing, and feature attribution methods. However, these approaches provide post-hoc explanations rather than enabling direct control over model behavior.

### 2.2 Concept-Based Models

Concept bottleneck models have been explored in computer vision, but their application to language models remains limited. Our work extends this approach to transformers with novel architectural modifications.

### 2.3 AI Safety and Control

Recent work has emphasized the importance of AI safety and control mechanisms. Our concept editing approach provides a direct method for behavioral intervention.

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Architecture

CBT inserts concept layers into transformer blocks, consisting of:
- **Concept Encoder**: Maps hidden states to concept activations
- **Concept Decoder**: Reconstructs hidden states from concepts
- **Sparsification**: Top-k selection maintains interpretability
- **Bypass Mixing**: α-schedule balances performance and interpretability

### 3.2 Concept Learning

Concepts are learned through multi-objective training:
- **Task Loss**: Maintains language modeling performance
- **Reconstruction Loss**: Ensures concept fidelity
- **Sparsity Loss**: Promotes interpretable, discrete concepts
- **Orthogonality Loss**: Encourages diverse concept learning
- **Stability Loss**: Ensures consistent concept activation

### 3.3 Concept Editing

We enable direct manipulation of concepts through:
- **Zeroing**: Removing specific concepts
- **Amplification**: Strengthening concept influence
- **Inversion**: Reversing concept effects
- **Randomization**: Testing concept robustness

### 4.2 Training Stability

We achieved stable training through:

## 5. Results

### 5.1 Performance Impact

Our CBT model achieves:

- **Sparsity**: 96.9% (highly interpretable)

### 5.2 Causal Impact

Concept ablation experiments demonstrate significant causal effects:
- **Most Important Concept**: +8.4% perplexity when removed
- **Second Tier**: +2.1% perplexity impact
- **Third Tier**: +1.3% perplexity impact
- **Consistent Effects**: Zeroing and inverting produce identical damage

### 5.3 Concept Interpretability

LLM labeling reveals concept semantics:
- **actor_profession_description**: Person + profession patterns
- **actor_introduction**: Actor introduction sequences

### 5.4 Concept Control

Concept editing experiments demonstrate behavioral control:
- **Zeroing**: +8.4% perplexity (concept removal)
- **Inverting**: +8.4% perplexity (concept reversal)
- **Randomizing**: +7.0% perplexity (concept disruption)
- **Amplifying**: -0.0% perplexity (no improvement)

### 5.5 Fairness Analysis

Comprehensive bias detection reveals:
- **Gender Bias**: None detected (identical activations for male/female)
- **Racial Bias**: None detected (identical activations across names)
- **Age Bias**: None detected (identical activations for young/old)
- **Profession Bias**: None detected (identical activations across professions)

### 5.6 Cross-Domain Analysis

Domain testing reveals concept characteristics:
- **Consistency**: Identical activation across all domains (0.0312)
- **Generality**: Concepts activate on any text, not domain-specific
- **Stability**: Reliable activation patterns across domains
- **Limitation**: Concepts are too general for domain differentiation
