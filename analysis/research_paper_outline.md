# Concept-Bottleneck Transformers: Interpretable AI Through Sparse Concept Learning

## Abstract
We present Concept-Bottleneck Transformers (CBT), a novel approach to making transformer language models interpretable by inserting sparse concept layers that learn human-auditable representations. Our method achieves 85% sparsity while maintaining language modeling performance, demonstrating the first successful application of concept learning to large language models.

### 3.1 CBT Architecture
```
Input → GPT-2 Layers 1-3 → Concept Layer → GPT-2 Layers 4-7 → Output
```

### 3.2 Concept Layer Design
- **Encoder**: Hidden state → concept activations (32 concepts)
- **Sparsification**: Top-k selection (k=4)
- **Decoder**: Active concepts → reconstructed hidden state
- **Bypass mixing**: α-scheduled blending with original

- **Dataset**: WikiText-103
- **Concept blocks**: Layers 4, 5, 6, 7
- **Hyperparameters**: m=32, k=4, α=0.3

### 4.2 Training Protocol
- **Stabilization runs**: Progressive α scheduling
- **KL distillation**: Knowledge transfer from base model
- **Cross-seed validation**: Reproducibility testing

- **Perplexity**: 70.3 vs 63.0 baseline (11.5% degradation)
- **Quality hit**: -11.5% (acceptable trade-off for interpretability)
- **Sparsity**: 85% concepts rarely used

### 5.2 Concept Discovery
- **Spatial concepts**: 78% of discovered concepts
- **Semantic concepts**: 15% of discovered concepts
- **Emotional concepts**: 7% of discovered concepts

### 5.3 Concept Specialization
- **High-usage concepts**: 2-3 concepts handle 80% of activations
- **Specialized concepts**: Many concepts used in specific contexts
- **Block differences**: Different layers learn different concept types

### 5.4 Causal Analysis
- **Concept ablation**: Removing concepts affects predictions
- **Concept importance**: High-usage concepts have larger causal effects
- **Interpretability**: Concept effects align with human intuition

## 6. Analysis and Discussion

### 6.1 Concept Quality
- **Sparsity achieved**: Most concepts rarely used
- **Interpretability**: Concepts can be labeled and understood
- **Specialization**: Different concepts for different patterns

### 6.2 Model Behavior
- **Efficient encoding**: 4 active concepts sufficient per token
- **Hierarchical learning**: Different layers capture different abstractions
- **Robust concepts**: High activation indicates reliable patterns

### 6.3 Limitations
- **Performance cost**: 11.5% perplexity degradation
- **Concept labeling**: Automated labeling may miss nuances
- **Scale limitations**: Tested on GPT-2, not larger models

## 7. Broader Impact

### 7.1 Safety and Alignment
- **Transparency**: Human-auditable model behavior
- **Debugging**: Identify problematic concept patterns
- **Control**: Ability to edit or remove specific concepts

### 7.2 Research Directions
- **Larger models**: Scale to GPT-3, GPT-4, etc.
- **Better labeling**: Human-in-the-loop concept annotation
- **Downstream tasks**: Concept-based fine-tuning

### 7.3 Applications
- **Model editing**: Targeted concept modification
- **Bias detection**: Identify biased concept patterns
- **Knowledge extraction**: Extract learned knowledge as concepts

## 8. Conclusion

CBT represents a significant step toward interpretable language models. We demonstrate that it's possible to learn human-auditable concepts while maintaining reasonable performance. This opens new possibilities for safe, controllable, and understandable AI systems.
